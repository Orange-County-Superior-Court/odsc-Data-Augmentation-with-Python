This is the code repository for [Data Augmentation with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-augmentation-with-python/9781803246451?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803246451), published by Packt.

**Enhance deep learning accuracy with data augmentation methods for image, text, audio, and tabular data**

## What is this book about?
Data is paramount in AI projects, especially for deep learning and generative AI, as forecasting accuracy relies on input datasets being robust. Acquiring additional data through traditional methods can be challenging, expensive, and impractical, and data augmentation offers an economical option to extend the dataset.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Write OOP Python code for image, text, audio, and tabular data
* Access over 150,000 real-world datasets from the Kaggle website
* Analyze biases and safe parameters for each augmentation method
* Visualize data using standard and exotic plots in color
* Discover 32 advanced open source augmentation libraries
* Explore machine learning models, such as BERT and Transformer
* Meet Pluto, an imaginary digital coding companion
* Extend your learning with fun facts and fun challenges

## üêæ Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
.pluto.remember_kaggle_access_keys("your_username_here", "your_key_here")
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists and students interested in the AI discipline. Advanced AI or deep learning skills are not required; however, knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks are essential to understanding the topics covered in this book.		 

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).


### Software and Hardware List

This book to be a hands-on journey. It will be more effective to read a chapter, run the code
on the Python Notebook, re-read the chapter‚Äôs part that confused you, and jump back to hacking the
code until the concept or technique is firmly understood.

| Software required                      | OS required                                  |
| ------------------------------------   | ---------------------------------------------|
| Python                                 | Chrome, Edge, Safari, or FireFox browser on  Windows, macOS, or Linux.                            
| Jupyter Notebook (Python Notebook)                                                  
| Python standard libraries, Panda,  Matplotlib, and Numpy                                                                            
| Python image, text, audio, and tabular data augmentation libraries.                   |                                             

The default online Jupyter Notebook is the Google Colab. You need a Google account. For other
online Jupyter Notebook, like Kaggle, Microsoft, or other online Jupyter Notebook, you need sign up
or have an account to their services.


We also provide a PDF file that has color images of the screenshots/diagrams used in this book. [Click here to download it](https://packt.link/FhpHV).
