**Enhance deep learning accuracy with data augmentation methods for image, text, audio, and tabular data**

## What is this book about?
Data is paramount in AI projects, especially for deep learning and generative AI, as forecasting accuracy relies on input datasets being robust. Acquiring additional data through traditional methods can be challenging, expensive, and impractical, and data augmentation offers an economical option to extend the dataset.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Write OOP Python code for image, text, audio, and tabular data
* Access over 150,000 real-world datasets from the Kaggle website
* Analyze biases and safe parameters for each augmentation method
* Visualize data using standard and exotic plots in color
* Discover 32 advanced open source augmentation libraries
* Explore machine learning models, such as BERT and Transformer
* Meet Pluto, an imaginary digital coding companion
* Extend your learning with fun facts and fun challenges

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
.pluto.remember_kaggle_access_keys("your_username_here",
"your_key_here")
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists and students interested in the AI discipline. Advanced AI or deep learning skills are not required; however, knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks are essential to understanding the topics covered in this book.		 

Basic knowledge of Python will help you get more from the examples.	
With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).

### Software and Hardware List

I designed this book to be a hands-on journey. It will be more effective to read a chapter, run the code
on the Python Notebook, re-read the chapterâ€™s part that confused you, and jump back to hacking the
code until the concept or technique is firmly understood.

The default online Jupyter Notebook is the Google Colab. You need a Google account. For other
online Jupyter Notebook, like Kaggle, Microsoft, or other online Jupyter Notebook, you need sign up
or have an account to their services.

## Get to Know the Author
**Duc Haba**
is a lifelong technologist and researcher. He has been a programmer, Enterprise Mobility
Solution Architect, AI Solution Architect, Principal, VP, CTO, and CEO. The companies range from
startups and IPOs to enterprise companies.
Ducâ€™s career started with Xerox Parc, researching and building expert systems (ruled-based) for
copier diagnostic, and skunk works for the USA DOD. Afterward, he joined Oracle, following Viant
Consulting as a founding member. He dove deep into the entrepreneurial culture in Silicon Valley.
There were slightly more failures than successes, but the highlights are Viant and RRKidz. Currently,
he is happy working at YML.co as the AI Solution Architect.
The book is only possible with the support of my family, fellow researchers, and a small gang of professionals
at Packt Publishing. Still, above all else, I hope you enjoy reading the book and hacking the Python
Notebook as much as I enjoyed writing it.
