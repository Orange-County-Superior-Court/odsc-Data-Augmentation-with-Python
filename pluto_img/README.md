- This is the folder where Pluto automatically saves any image or graphs he created from any Wrapper functions on the Python Notebooks. 
- The file name convention is: pluto{x}.jpg
- -  The "x" is the numeric start with zero, and the "pluto.fname_id" is the incremental variable. 
- -  In other words, at start up, the "self.fname_id" set to zero, but you reset it to any number.
